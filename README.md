# data-analytics-projects ðŸ“Š
You may find here some of my data analysis projects where I answer different questions through data analysis and statistics. I also publish business intelligence dashboards.

Tools I use: 
  - Jupyter notebook, VS Code to write my code
  - PowerBI for visualization and data modelling.
  - SQL for data cleansing.
  - Python for multi-purpose data wrangling and analysis ( Matplotlib, seaborn, Pandas, Numpy )
  - Selenium, BeautifulSoup for data scraping and automation

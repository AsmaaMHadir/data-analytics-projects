# data-analytics-projects ðŸ“Š
You may find here some of my data analysis projects where I answer different questions through data analysis and statistics. I also publish business intelligence dashboards.

Tools I use: 
  - Jupyter notebook, VS Code to write my code
  - PowerBI for visualization and data modelling.
  - SQL for data cleansing.
  - Python for multi-purpose data wrangling and analysis ( Matplotlib, seaborn, Pandas, Numpy )
  - Selenium, BeautifulSoup for data scraping and automation

# Projects outline: 

## 1- [Tech Youtube Channels Analysis](https://github.com/AsmaaMHadir/data-analytics-projects/tree/main/Youtube%20Channels%20Analysis/notebooks): How did the content trends for AI, Data Science, and Machine Learning Youtube channels change within the last 5 years? 
In this project, I collect data about some of the biggest and active Youtube channels that provide educational content about Machine Learning and Data Science in order to extract insights about which topics were popular each year for the last 5 years from 2018 arriving to 2023. 
These Youtube channels would typically provide tutorials or guided projects sharing knowledge about frameworks, tools, languages, architectures etc. as well as advice and insights about the applied Machine Leatrning and Data Scientist profession. The dataset excludes specialized channels that provide content in a specific area such as data analysis.

- Data Source: Youtube API provides access to rich data about youtube channels.
- Data Analysis: Pandas, Numpy.
- Data Visualization: Seaborn, Matplotlib
 
  1- Step 1: Data Extraction
  ( include snippet of the dataset)
  2- Step 2: Data cleansing
  2- Step 3: Dataset statistics
    - Number of youtube channels
    - Number of collected videos
    - Average video views
    - Average channel subscription count
  3- Step 4: Feature extraction
  4- Step 5: Visualize
